    <h1 style="font-size: 2.5em; color: #222222; text-align: center;">Privacy Policy</h1>
  

    <p>At <strong>Next Town Movers</strong> ("we", "us", or "our"), we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard the information you provide to us when visiting our website <a href="http://NextTownMovers.com" style="color: #333; text-decoration: none;">NextTownMovers</a>. By using our website and services, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 40px;">Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you interact with our website, we may collect various types of information to provide you with a smooth and personalized experience. This includes personal information you voluntarily submit to us—such as your name, phone number, email address, and moving-related details you provide through forms or quote requests. We may also collect data automatically through your browser or device, such as your IP address, location, device type, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, and how you interact with our site. This helps us analyze trends, administer the site, and enhance the user experience.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 40px;">How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information collected from you for several purposes. Primarily, we use it to respond to your inquiries, deliver requested moving services, process transactions, and provide customer support. Additionally, we may use your data to improve the functionality of our website, personalize your experience, analyze website performance, and communicate updates, promotions, or service-related notices (with your consent). We may also use the data for internal recordkeeping, legal compliance, or fraud prevention purposes.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 40px;">Sharing and Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
    <p>We understand the importance of your privacy and do not sell your personal data. However, we may share your information with third-party vendors, service providers, or business partners who assist us in operating our website or delivering our services—such as payment processors, IT service providers, and customer service platforms. These partners are contractually obligated to handle your data securely and in accordance with applicable privacy laws. We may also disclose your information if required by law or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal obligations or protect our rights, property, or safety.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 40px;">Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>Our website uses cookies and other tracking technologies to enhance your experience. Cookies are small text files stored on your device that allow us to recognize your browser and remember your preferences on future visits. These cookies may be used for site functionality, analytics, and marketing. You can choose to accept or decline cookies through your browser settings.

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 40px;">Data Security</h2>
    <p>We are dedicated to protecting your personal data and implement reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. These measures include secure server connections, encryption where appropriate, and internal access controls. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 40px;">Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>Our website may contain links to other websites not operated by us. Once you leave our site and visit a third-party website, we are no longer responsible for how your data is handled. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any external websites you visit to understand how they collect and use your information.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 40px;">Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you, request corrections, or ask for it to be deleted under certain circumstances. You may also opt out of receiving marketing emails from us at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link or contacting us directly. If you have any privacy-related concerns, we encourage you to contact us and we will respond promptly.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 40px;">Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our website and services are intended for users who are at least 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

    <p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time, in response to changes in our practices or legal obligations. When we do, we will revise the “Effective Date” at the top of this page. We recommend reviewing this page periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.</p>
